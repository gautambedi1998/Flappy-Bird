# Flappy-Bird
This repo contains the code for  the flappy bird game which is implemented using react hooks for the state management. It is a perfect project for learning css positioning and hooks. Please feel free to download code and play the game. Currently game works as expected. It would be interesting to add powers to this game to make it more enjoyable and It would be a perfect opportunity to learn and refine your coding skills.

Enjoy coding :)
